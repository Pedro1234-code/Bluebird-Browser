  <h2>Mobium</h2>
  <a>Forked from Penguin2001's Bluebird Browser. Mobium is a WebView2 based browser made for use with MobileOS project. It's optimized for mobile and not meant to be used on desktop as it includes a mobile user agent.</a>
</div>

## Changes:

- Changed UA to Microsoft Edge Android.

- Launches CoreShell when closing.

- Removed "Ask AI" button because there's already a Copilot PWA in MobileOS project and it was buggy.
